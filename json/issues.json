This project is an attempt to ensure consistency and perseverance of these open source projects regardless of the commercial direction of the company. Projects like Salt have been providing for the infrastructure needs for 10s of thousands of clients for over a decade. This includes many not for profit and government agencies like JPL and NASA. This project will create an archive of the pipeline data, documentation, and enablement from previous versions of Salt and Idem initially to allow for a long lasting archive that can be access for groups that may be on older, no longer supported versions of the software. If this is successful it could expand to other VMware open source projects.```What is the primary source of funding for this project?```This project is being funded by VMware as a validation project to see if providing replicas for this data on Filecoin is a viable option. This is being driven by the Salt and Idem Open Source teams.```What other projects/ecosystem stakeholders is this project associated with?```none```## Use",

These pipelines will be prototyped and demonstrated using one year of Landsat 9 satellite data, which is estimated at about 500TB per replication.

I learned about blockchain in 2015 and was deeply attracted by its charm. But at that time, it was just a hobby.It was not until 2020 that I decided to officially resign and switch to the blockchain industry. Because at this time I have accumulated a certain amount of capital, even if I had no income at the beginning, I can still maintain my daily life. Since then, I have independently studied various blockchain projects, produced corresponding videos, and uploaded them to major social networking sites to obtain everyone's recognition and certain financial returns. With more and more videos, my own hard disk is no longer enough (so far, I have spent three 1T hard disks). Therefore, I think the real storage plan of filecoin is very useful for me, so I want to apply for some shares so that my videos can be saved for a long time.```What is the primary source of funding for this project?```My own savings and income from some platforms```What other projects/ecosystem stakeholders is this project associated with?```none```## Use",

Artists' artistic activities freely present communication and sharing, but they are alienated and shunned. In addition, the artists' fields and genres were different, so they could not know and communicate with each other, while their exclusive and ignorant attitudes toward other genres deepened their alienation.Now we need the communication of artists in different genres and the proper channels to represent artists. Accordingly, we would like to establish the Korean Artists Council to continuously communicate with artists about companies and policies and expand our activities overseas.```What is the primary source of funding for this project?```From our income.```What other projects/ecosystem stakeholders is this project associated with?```No```## Use",
